A simple script to convert relatively (but not exactly) black text to black in a PDF.

My use case is when printing near-black text, the halftoning bothers
me and I would prefer pure black text.

To use, first install pymupdf in a venv and then run the script: https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
